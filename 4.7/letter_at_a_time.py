# Question 1:
# If you print range(7), you'll see something like range(0, 7). It shows the start and stop but doesnâ€™t actually list the numbers.
# If you convert it to a list using list(range(7)), you'll get [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], which lists all the numbers from 0 up to (but not including) 7.

# Question 2:
# The length of "Hello" is 5, so range(5) would be sent to the loop.
# The numbers inside that range would be: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].

# Question 3:
# The length of "box" is 3.
# The last character 'x' has an index of 2 (since indexing starts at 0).

# Question 4 (updated code):
