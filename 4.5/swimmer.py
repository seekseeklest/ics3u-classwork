# 1. Do Goofus and Gallant swim for the same amount of time if you input 80.5 as the current water temperature?
# Answer: No, they do not swim for the same amount of time. Gallant stops swimming when the temperature drops below 79째F,
# but Goofus swims even when it drops below that point, due to his loop continuing until 'break'.

# 2. Run the program with a starting temperature of 78. What changes?
# Answer: Gallant doesn't swim at all because the starting temperature is below 79째F.
# Goofus swims once, even though the temperature is below 79째F.

# 3. Does Gallant check the water temperature first, or does he just dive right in?
# Answer: Gallant checks the water temperature first before swimming. He doesn't swim if it's too cold.

# 4. Does Goofus check the water temperature first or just dive in?
# Answer: Goofus doesn't check the temperature first. He just dives right in and only stops when the water gets too cold.

# 5. What is the difference between the first while loop and the second while loop? What does the 'break' keyword do?
# Answer: The first while loop checks the temperature before Gallant swims, so he doesn't swim if it's too cold.
# The second while loop (Goofus) always runs at least once, and 'break' stops the loop when the temperature drops below 79째F.

# 6. Which loop is a pre-test loop and which is a post-test loop?
# Answer: Gallant's loop is a pre-test loop because it checks the condition before swimming.
# Goofus's loop is a post-test loop because it runs at least once and then checks the condition.
